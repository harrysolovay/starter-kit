# starter-kit
Used Gulp to create a clean development environment with easy production building. Browserify, Compass, CSS auto-prefixing (no need for pesky @include(...)), Browserify, Uglify, HTML &amp; CSS minification, development &amp; production local server configurations, image compression, and more!

# CLI
**"$ gulp"** will start the development server on http://localhost:8080 with livereload â€“ all HTML, SCSS & JavaScript are being watched for file changes to trigger a reload  
**"$ gulp build"** will minify all of the resources into the "dist" directory  
**"$ gulp production:images"** will minify all images from the "app" directory into the same folder structure in "dist"  
**"$ gulp production:serve"** will load up the "dist" or production version in the browser  

# Parting words
Let me know what you think. This is how I've come to work on projects... I'm sure there are  practices that I should implement in this development environment. Please let me know what they are and what would be most valuable for me to look into ( [harrysolovay@gmail.com](harrysolovay@gmail.com) | [harrysolovay.com](harrysolovay.com) ). Thank you.
